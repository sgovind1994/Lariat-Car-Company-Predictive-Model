## General Information
My main objectives with this project were to: 

1)Increase the overall net revenue of the company

2)Attempt to lower costs as much as possible

3)Find out which cars are generating the least/most profit and why

I came up with three potential strategies, and saw which strategy would be the most effective in getting me optimized results:

1)Strategy 1:Assume consistent  structure and no growth or decrease in number of cars

2)Strategy 2: Discontinue renting out car make "Morgan", in order to try and lower total costs/month

3)Strategy 3: Increase the supply of car make "Ford" cars, and ensure more of those are rented out, in order to increase revenue and lower costs/month
